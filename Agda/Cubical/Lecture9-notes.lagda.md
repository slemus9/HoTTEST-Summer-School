# Lecture 9

Rough plan:

- Cubical univalence (Glue types) + SIP

- Some cool example of transporting programs/proofs using the SIP and
  then computing with the result

- Maybe something with matrices and polynomials?

```agda
{-# OPTIONS --cubical #-}

module Lecture9-notes where

open import cubical-prelude
open import Lecture7-notes
open import Lecture8-notes
```
